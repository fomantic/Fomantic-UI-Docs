# Fomantic Docs

NOTE: Fomantic was created to continue active development of Semantic-UI and has the intent to be merged back into the master repository once active development can restart. For more info please read the following issues https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6109 https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6413

This folder contains the templates used to generate the static website for [fomantic-ui.com](http://fomantic-ui.com). 

This repo can be used to create a fork of the UI documents to serve as styleguide for your project.

### Installing Dependencies


You must install [DocPad](http://github.com/docpad/docpad), the static site generator used to create the HTML for the site, to render the contents of this repository.
```bash
npm install -g docpad@6.83.2
docpad install;
```

Then finally to start the server
```bash
docpad run
```

### Generating Fomantic UI for Docs

Assuming two sibling folders:

1. UI folder ./ui
2. Docs folder ./docs

Directory structure should look like this:
```
fomantic/
├── ui/
│   ├── node_modules/
|   ├── ...
├── docs/
│   ├── node_modules/
|   ├── ...
```

* Clone both repos to respective folders
* `npm install` in `./ui`
* `npm install` in `./docs`
* Go through Fomantic UI installer steps (auto)
* In `./ui` folder `gulp build-docs` (builds files to ./docs)
* In `./docs` folder `docpad install` then `docpad run`
* Go to http://localhost:9778/ docs should be there
* Optionally run `gulp serve-docs` in ./ui to serve any changes from ./ui/src to ./docs

### Running the Server

Start the docs server (and generate docs):

```
# run from inside docs folder that will now contain the compiled docs
# windows users can then navigate to http://localhost:9778
docpad run
```


Watch for changes from your UI folder, and serve to the docs instance:

```
gulp serve-docs
```

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

You can publish your docs to GitHub Pages from the command line automatically
```
docpad deploy-ghpages --env static
```
